# FigMayo Open Sauce 🍯

Our goal at FigMayo is to make sophisticated design system practices as low-friction as possible for smaller, time-pressed teams. As part of this effort, we want to share our internal tools with the community.

We try to optimize for simple, low-energy solutions to complex problems—but we might not always hit the mark. Hopefully, you can find something of value here.

## 🙋‍♂️ What is FigMayo?

FigMayo instantly converts any Figma library into a fully functional documentation reference website you can share with your team. All your styles, variables and components are included allowing stakeholders to browse and explore your design work.

Give developers the tools they need to inspect components & variables, copy styles and play with your variants and props. Easily add Storybook, Github markdown, code samples and more.
